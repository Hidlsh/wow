3. Bookmark the page and leave the bookmark as is; name it whatever you want or something you can remember - ```MAKE SURE THE BOOKMARKS ARE ON YOUR BOOKMARKS BAR, THIS IS REQUIRED```

    - Set the url to: ```javascript:let extStatus = false``` - and save the changes.

4. open the lol.js file within this repository, click ```raw``` and copy all (CTRL + A, CTRL + C) the text in the page it redirects you to. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67646781/190871894-3a3990de-67b3-4348-adac-4cb5adb387b7.png)

5. Reload the page and bookmark it again
   - This time, edit the url and put this in: ```javascript:(code you copied from lol.js file)``` - NO SPACE AFTER THE COLON ( : ) JUST PASTE THE CODE. It should look exactly like this:

After following those steps correctly, head back to the webstorex link as specified in step 1.
  - Firstly, click on the bookmark created from step 3.
  - Secondly, click on the bookmark created from step 5. Then you should see that the bookmarks on your chromebook have all been grayed out.
To Double check if it worked, open the extensions manager within Chrome: ```Three dots (top right) -> More Tools -> Extensions.```

You should now see that your Classroom (Lightspeed Systems - Classroom Management), CatchOn, Gopher Buddy, DF Tube, and LightSpeed Filter Agent, and all other extensions have been disabled - Leaving Adblock as the only enabled Extension.
You can still manually re-enable all of your own personally installed extensions.

In any situation that you need to have the District's extensions re-enabled, you can either ```restart your chromebook```, OR

```Go back to step 3```, create another extension on ```google.com```, and change extStatus = ```false``` to ```true```.

Then head back to the webstorex link from step 1, click on the new bookmark that you made (which you should have in your bookmarks bar), then click on the ```bookmark you made from step 5.```
